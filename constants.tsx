Build piece by piece, refining as you go.\n- **High-Level Direction:** Focus on *what* to build, not *how* to type it. Let the AI manage the syntax.\n- **Trust but Verify:** Always review the AI\'s output. It\'s a powerful tool, but the human is the final authority.\n- **Embrace the "Vibe":** Use descriptive language to guide the AI\'s design choices (e.g., "Make the UI clean and modern, with a professional feel").' }
